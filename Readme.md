## Backlog

- I can't get autofill to stop showing up
- The zoom is not working great, I often have to scroll to see events
- We need more events
- save a timeline
- Event Update
  - delete events
  - update events color
  - update event description
- I can share a timeline with a url

- User Events
  - I should not be able to add two events with the same name.
  - It's annoying to look up the date of new events
  - I should be able to not add the entire date if I don't want to.
    - I should probably switch to optional fields
  - The add events button could have nice styling
