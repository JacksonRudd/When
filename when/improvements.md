- **set child height to scrollHeight not vp:** I have a child inside of parent element. The parent element has a scrollbar. Therefore there are two heights associated with the parent - the view height, which is set to 800 px, and the height of the full scroll, which is much longer. I want to set the child height to the scroll height and not to just 800 px. The reason is I want the child to be present through the whole scrollbar. When I set the child's height to 100%, it actually just sets it to the view height and I end up scrolling past it.
